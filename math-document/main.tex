\title{Riemann-Roch Theorem}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The main goal of this paper is to understand the Riemann-Roch theorem for complex plane curves. This is done by first introducing the notion of complex curves, continuing with the tools used to prove lemmas and theorem such as Bezout theorem and Degree-Genus formula. In addition, holomorphic and meromorphic functions defined on curves are mentioned. Divisors and their important properties are given. These preliminaries build the way to an elementary proof of the theorem. Lastly, some corollaries and important applications are provided.
