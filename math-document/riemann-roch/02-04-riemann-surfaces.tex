\subsection{Riemann Surfaces}

\begin{definition}[Riemann surface]\label{def:rs}
    A \vocab{Riemann surface} is a connected complex one dimensional manifold which is locally homeomorphic to $\CC$ i.e any point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\CC$. The feature of Riemann surfaces that interests this paper the most is that it makes sense to do complex analysis and define holomorphic and meromorphic functions on them. A \vocab{holomorophic function} on a Riemann surface $S$ is a holomorphic map from $S$ to $\CC$ and a \vocab{meromorphic function} on $S$ is a holomorphic map from $S$ to $\overline{\CC}=\CC\cup\{\infty\}$. Sphere, torus, and the curves that this paper is dealing with are the most famous examples.
\end{definition}

\Cref{def:rs} is from Definition 10 in \cite{ref:terrytao} (Terence Tao).

\begin{definition}[differential]\label{def:differential}
    A \vocab{meromorphic differential} on $\curveC$ is a symbol $df$ which satisfy the following relations
    \begin{align*}
        d(f+g) &= df+dg\\
        d(fg) &= fdg+gdf\\
        da &= 0
    \end{align*}
    for any meromorphic functions $f$, $g$ on $\curveC$ and $a\in\CC$.
\end{definition}

\Cref{def:differential} is from Chapter 4 of \cite{ref:hampus} (Hampus).
